          <p><b>DairyVue360</b> is a one for all solution for the wellbeing of your herd. It offers many unique solutions in the domain of <span class="b-light">Herd Fertility, Milking and Health.</span> It consists of a Mobile App and Web Dashboard that helps farmers connect with other physical Dairymaster products that own in their farm to access data in real-time.</p>
          <p>This Case Study only deals with the <span class="b-light"> Milking Section</span> on the <span class="b-light">DairyVue360 Mobile App.</span>A similar Design Process was followed to design other pages of the Mobile App and Web Dashboard.</p>

          <br>
          <h2 class="small-title" ">Challenge 1</h2>
          <p>While <b>DairyVue360</b> is being used across all levels of Farming, yet companies like Dairymaster are innovation leaders in the field to discover, invent and develop new product and features.<span class="o-light">The research required to conduct UX studies is dependant on field experts rather than end users themselves.</span> The field experts who work with us have farming experience themselves and hence provide a good perspective on the product problems as well as innovation ideas.</p>
          <br>
          <h2 class="small-title" ">Challenge 2</h2>
          <p><span class="o-light"><b>DairyVue360</b> is an expert level software with wide, specific and niche features</span> hence it becomes more challenging to define the design vision in such a way that makes it as easy as <span class="o-light">possible for every farmer to use it with the least amount of training.</span></p>
          <br>
          <h2 class="small-title" ">Challenge 3</h2>
          <p>We offer our App and Web Dashboard in several countries across the globe. This introduces challenges like <span class="o-light">cultural/metric differences in farming practices.</span> We also have<span class="o-light">farms varying in size from 10 animals to a 10,000 animals in a few farms.</span></p>
