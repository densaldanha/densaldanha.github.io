This exploration for this activity was found out to be in the space that everyone could relate to and empathize well with a plethora of scope to find common problems to address. The design activity was initiated by facilitating the two participant teams with a domain each to work with. The teams had the freedom of selecting any domain from the 5 areas that were presented to them. One of the teams went ahead with the Accommodation and the other with healthcare. These two areas provided immense scope for exploration of real-time problems in Ireland. It was insightful to observe the thought process of the two groups that were identifying and exploring the design space in the problem areas. Both the groups were distinct in their approaches to understanding and solving the problem. The groups explored the activity by the means of design and ideation tools such as mind-mapping and sketching.
                 </p>

            

            <h3>Group A</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The group that had the Accommodation Topic started by understanding the various problems in the sector. They listed down all the problems that they could empathize with as international students in the country and placed them in an order of their importance contributing to their experience of finding accommodation.</p>
            
            <img class="blog_image justify-content-center img-fluid" src="/Blogs/week5imgs/pic1.jpeg" width="600px" height="400px"  alt="Wearable Tech"></img>
            <img class="blog_image justify-content-center img-fluid" src="/Blogs/week5imgs/pic2.jpeg" width="600px" height="400px"  alt="Wearable Tech"></img>

            <p class="paragraph">The group approached solving their problems with the current housing crisis in mind, however, in the scenario, the attention to the perspective of the landlords was not of a great focus point. They concluded that the communication between landlords and possible tenants was the weakest link in the chain of this big accommodation crisis. Keeping smart technology in their minds, they imagined a smart AI assistant that works as the middle man between the possible tenants and the Landlords. They named it ‘Skipper’. This smart AI assistant is designed to keep in mind the various gray areas of communication between tenants and Landlords. Managing rent, keeping the house clean and safe, reducing electricity bills, managing deposits, and avoiding the inconvenience and legal issues, were some of the key preliminary tasks of Skipper. This was coupled with a smart VR experience of the house from wherever you are to gain an insight of the house even before they move there. This was seen to be a major relief for international students, from the groups’ perspective.</p>
            <h3>Major Criticism by the opposition group:</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The other group were curious to know why the landlords would adopt this AI assistant because it seemed to be benefiting only the tenants. They mentioned that adding features that would be beneficial to the landlords would help in spreading the word about this AI assistant.</p>

            <h3>Group B</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">This group proceeded with a mighty task of imagining a better healthcare system. This was seen to be a challenging task just like the housing crisis healthcare is perceived to be in a poor state as well. In this space of problems, the group leveraged this and proceeded with an innovative take on the problem. They designed capitalist-oriented solutions in a critical manner to shed light in the current world paradigm with technology and the profit oriented mindset.</p>
            <img class="blog_image justify-content-center img-fluid" src="/Blogs/week5imgs/pic3.jpeg" width="600px" height="400px"  alt="Wearable Tech"></img>
            <img class="blog_image justify-content-center img-fluid" src="/Blogs/week5imgs/pic4.jpeg" width="600px" height="400px"  alt="Wearable Tech"></img>
            <img class="blog_image justify-content-center img-fluid" src="/Blogs/week5imgs/pic5.jpeg" width="600px" height="400px"  alt="Wearable Tech"></img>

            <p class="paragraph">They leveraged the diversity aspect of the team and highlighted healthcare scenarios of their respective countries. This started a conversation about how the current system lacks a lot of facilities and there was more need for innovation here. By creating a mind map they were able to visualize problems surrounding the topic of healthcare. They came up with a "futuristic" healthcare plan that would be classified into three major price groups. The Pricing groups included a Basic, Standard and Premium plan that users could choose amongst. And just when this concept was settling in to get under the skin of the people listening to their ideas they leveraged the metaphor to come up with an idea of a Brain chip, which would be in a literal sense be  “under the skin” of the candidate opting for this solution. Each of these pricing groups consisted of various features that also came with a bigger price tag as you moved up the pricing ladder.</p>
            <h3>Major Criticism by the opposition group:</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The main concern of the other group was "Privacy". Everyone witnessing their presentation felt that embedding a brain chip into people's heads would be a threat to their privacy. The guidelines of such tech could be very dangerous and something that you would need to think hard about before accepting the terms and conditions of this condoning technology. Another major concern was the classification of healthcare into these different price segments that were not well thought out. Listing some ailments under the cover for premium would suggest that those ailments are more serious than the others. Justification of certain treatments under certain price segments felt inappropriate and unjust - This was believed to be the outcome of the team as they had a critical take on the design idea and aimed at creating a provocative conversation about the same.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In conclusion, for this activity, we were very pleased to see the two groups think hard yet innovatively and come up with creative solutions to the problems in their respective domains. The main focus of conducting this activity was to make them think big and use smart tech as a means of imagining the future which was well executed.</p>
